                    published by Rockstar Games. It is the fifth main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series,
                    following
                    2002's Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, and the seventh installment overall. It was released in

                    2004 for the PlayStation 2, in June 2005 for Microsoft Windows and Xbox, and in November 2010
                    for
                    Mac OS X.[2][3] The game is set within an open world environment that players can explore and

                <p><b>Grand Theft Auto III</b> received critical acclaim, with particular praise directed at its
                    concept
                    and gameplay. However, it also generated controversy, with criticism directed at its depictions
                    of
                    violence and sex. It became the best-selling video game of 2001, and sold over 14.5 million
                    copies
                    by March 2008. Considered by many critics as one of the most significant titles of the sixth
                    generation of video games and a landmark game in the open world concept, it is often listed
                    among
                    the greatest video games. It won several year-end accolades, including Game of the Year awards
                    from
                    several gaming publications. Since its release, it has received ports to many different gaming
                    platforms. An enhanced version of the game was released on mobile platforms in 2011 for the
                    game's
                    tenth anniversary, and a further enhanced version for the twentieth anniversary was released in
                    2021. The game was followed by 2002's Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, while two prequels, Grand
                    Theft
                    Auto Advance and Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories, were released in 2004 and 2005,
                    respectively.
